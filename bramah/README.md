h1. How to

In order to be able to act as a HID keyboard, the arduino uno little CPU that acts as USB bridge has to be flashed with a keyboard HID firmware. But, with a keyboard HID firmware, we can't send new sketch, so we have to flash it again to the original firmware.

There is two scrips :
flash-keyboard.sh
flash-original.sh

Before launching any of them, we must put the little CPU in flashing mode,
making briefly a bridge between RST and GND. Hard reboot is necessary after
each flash.

h1. Bugs

- The '\' is printed as the Yen symbol.

- Only 16 characters are printed on scree



h1. Diary

h3. Day 8
Bought components on the internet. Notably : 
- Arduino nano : I expect it to work like UNO and be able to flash it to act as
  a keyboard
- Arduino micro : Apparently less powerful but ship comes with USB keyboard for
  free.
No Code :(

h3. Day 6-7
The weekend. Display is OK. I mean I can type on keypad and characters are
output on LCD. I struggle a lot with C++ because I program without having an in
depth knowledge of the language. The wiring of the LCD is painful.
Next step is to implement backspace and enter.

h3. Day 5
Got a multitap keypad. But I don't like it. Usage is horrible and so is the
underlying code. A T9 style input would be so much better. And the Keypad 
library is unsuitable for my needs (is it?). And there is no backspace,
*no bullshit*.

h3. Day 4
Spent some time finding a nice way to have input. I opt for a keypad with
multitap, but I'm too lazy to try anything this evening.
The Keypad library that comes with arduino can support this. There is an
example called DynamicKeypad.ino.

h3. Day 3
I finally managed to generate a password and type it on keyboard.
I have to check that my mapping to hid is correct.

h3. Day 2
Tried to use the Keyboard library but it doesn't work with Uno
Found 2 workarounds :
- A soft usb :

But I need some electronic components
- Flash the ATMEGA that control the USB. Seems tedious.

Finally, opted for flashing the USB controller.
Now, I have to use http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/Hut1_12v2.pdf in order
to output the correct letter. 

h3. Day 1

Had a first POC : can generate a SHA256 and Base64 the output
